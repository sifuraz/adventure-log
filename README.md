## Features

* Automatically calculates the amount of time wasted on non-epic tasks, like inventory management and spell preparation.
* Generates meaningless statistics that nobody will ever read, but will impress your fellow adventurers nonetheless.
* Provides a platform for you to complain about your lack of epic adventure without actually doing anything about it.
* Manage your campaigns and characters, because let's face it, that's where the real adventure lies.

## Troubleshooting

* If the app crashes, just blame the DM. It's always the DM's fault.

* If you forget your password, don't bother resetting it. Just create a new account and start over.
* If you encounter any other issues, just pretend they don't exist and continue with your campaign.

## Conclusion

Thank you for using the Adventure Log! We hope you enjoy reliving the most epic moments of your campaign. Remember, the journey may not always be exciting, but at least you have this app to make it seem like it is.
